# Coursera-AndrewNg-MachineLearning

This Github Repo consists of lecture notes, following Andrew Ng's [Machine Learning course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) on Coursera.

Personally, I use it to refresh concepts that I have learnt during university and to note them down in a (hopefully) understandable fashion for later reference
